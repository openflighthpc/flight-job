This script will start an interactive desktop session on a login node and
submit a job to run on a compute node.  Once that session is running,
resources will be requested from the scheduler to run your job script.

When you submit the script you will be given the opportunity to specify the
expected runtime, the expected memory limit, the name of the job and the
application you wish to use.

The desktop session will be available from the job page or via [Flight
Desktop](/desktop).

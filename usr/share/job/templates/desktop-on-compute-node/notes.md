This script will submit a job to run an interactive desktop session on the
first available node.  The script can be edited to customize the applications
that are launched once the desktop session is started.

When you submit the script you will be given the opportunity to specify the
expected runtime, the expected memory limit, the name of the job and the
application you wish to use.

The desktop session will be available from the job page or via [Flight
Desktop](/desktop).

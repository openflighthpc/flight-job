synopsis: Submit a job that has multiple processes where all processes need to reside on a single host.
description: |
  This allows you to specify the total number of cores required for a job on a
  single node. The remaining cores will be shared with other jobs.

  As this method allocates cores on a single machine, it may take longer to
  allocate your job. You may wish to consider using an MPI slots job to
  reserve cores over multiple nodes.

    description: >
      Enter the expected runtime for your job.  Specification of a shorter
      runtime will cause the scheduler to be more likely to schedule your job
      sooner, but note that your job **will be terminated if it is still
      executing after the time specified**.

      A time limit of zero requests that no time limit be imposed.  The format
      is one of "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds",
      "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".
      e.g. `3-0` for 3 days.

    description: >
      Enter the expected memory usage of your job.  Specification of a smaller
      memory requirement will cause the scheduler to be more likely to
      schedule your job sooner, but note that your job **may be terminated if
      it exceeds the specified allocation**.

      Note that this setting is specified in megabytes.  e.g. specify `1024`
      for 1 gigabyte.

      Specify the number of processing slots required for your job.

      You should request a processing slot for each simultaneous thread
      (or process) that your script and/or application executes.  Note
      that requesting a larger number of slots will mean that your job
      could take longer to launch.

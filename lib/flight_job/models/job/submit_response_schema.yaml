# NOTE: JSON Schema
#
# This document contains the response specification for the "submit script".
#
# It uses JSON:Schema as its validation library:
# https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html
#
# This document uses YAML to support syntax highlighting and comments;
# otherwise it is regular JSON.
#==============================================================================
# NOTE: Independent Versioning
#
# The 'submit.sh` provides core functionality that flight-job relies on to
# operate correctly. This functionality will change over time as part of minor
# release.
#
# For this reason, the specification is version independently to the CLI.
#==============================================================================
# CHANGELOG:
# * 2.3.0 - Extracted Specification
#==============================================================================
# ARGV:
#
# The argument vector to the 'submit.sh' is as follows:
#
# 1. The absolute path to the render script
